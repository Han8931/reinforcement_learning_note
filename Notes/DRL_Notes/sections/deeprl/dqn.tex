\chapter{Deep Q-Network}
Q-learning is a popular model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that is used to find an optimal action-selection policy for a given finite Markov decision process (MDP). It's a form of temporal difference learning, where the agent learns from the consequences of its actions in the environment.

The main goal of $Q$-learning is to learn a policy, represented by the action-value function $Q(s,a)$, which estimates the expected cumulative future rewards of taking action $a$ in state $s$.
